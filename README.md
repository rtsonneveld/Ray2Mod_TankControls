# Ray2Mod_TankControls

## How to Use
1. Go to the [releases page](
https://github.com/rtsonneveld/Ray2Mod_RollBoostPracticeTool/releases/)
2. Download the latest release
3. Unzip the file
4. Launch run.bat
5. Open Rayman 2, the mod will be activated automatically

## Notes
- The mod will only work with keyboard controls at the moment
- Press P to invert the function of the Shift key so holding Shift makes Rayman run instead of walk, to more closely simulate the controls found in Tonic Trouble: Special Edition

## Known Bugs
- Pulling up a ledge after climbing doesn't work
- The teensie dance will repeat indefinitely if you walk backwards during it
- The Clark bossfight can break if you walk backwards during the cutscene
